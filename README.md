Rent Home Now is the front-end final capstone project for the Full Stack Developer Program at Microverse.

Rent Home Now is a website that facilitates the connection between property owners interested in renting out their properties and potential renters. This site allows for the creation of reservations on selected properties. It has been developed using the Redux framework and uses an own API that you can visit by clicking on [here](https://github.com/shahadat3669/rent-home-now-api).

The app was built with a Ruby on Rails backend and a React/Redux frontend, located on separate repositories.
